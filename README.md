# TennisPlayerProfile

Developed during my MSc at the University of Macedonia.

The user can create one or more tennis player profiles. A profile is initially empty and the user can add below information:
- Personal details
- Matches (include info about win/defeat, opponent, score etc)
- Won cups

The profiles are dynamic and the user can add more information later on. Also, the local storage is used in order to store the details of the profiles and retrieve them when the user re-visits the page.

For the development, pure HTML, CSS and JavaSript were used.

# Testing

Checkout the project and open the `index.html` file
